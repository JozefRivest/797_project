  abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between U.S. overseas
              troops and the willingness of the citizens of host states to fight
              for their country. The study joins the long-running debate about
              burden-sharing and free-riding among U.S. allies. Unlike most
              previous empirical studies, we focus on non-material or intangible
              measures of the underlying concepts. Our dependent variable
              estimates the proportion of citizens expressing a willingness to
              fight for their country. Scores at the aggregate-national as well
              as the individual level are shaped by the presence of U.S. military
              forces, which act as a “tripwire” signaling credible security
              commitments. This increases opportunities of (non-material)
              free-riding. We present both bivariate and multivariate analyses
              covering the period 1981–2014 to test this supposition. Findings
              indicate that once U.S. troop levels reach a certain threshold
              (between 100 and 500 troops), citizens’ willingness to fight drops
              significantly. This likely reflects non-material free-riding.},

              the social fabric of host nations and policy implications for the

  abstract = {In a recently published article, Allen et al. (Outside the wire:
              U.S. military deployments and public opinion in host states’,
              American Political Science Review, 114(2), 326–341; 2020) argue
              that US military deployments nurture favorable attitudes toward the
              United States among foreign citizens. Their claim is based on
              social contact and economic compensation theories, applied to a
              large-scale cross-national survey project funded by the US
              government. However, their analysis disregards the geographical
              concentration of US military facilities within the host countries.
              To examine the relevance of geography and assess both positive and
              negative externalities, we focus on Japan – a notable case given
              its status as the country hosting the largest number of US military
              personnel in the world. We show that residents of Okinawa, a small
              prefecture hosting 70\% of US military facilities within Japan have
              considerably unfavorable attitudes toward the US military presence
              in their prefecture. They hold this negative sentiment specifically
              toward the bases in Okinawa regardless of their contact with
              Americans and economic benefits and their general support for the
              US military presence within Japan. Our findings support an
              alternative theory of not-in-my-backyard. They also shed light on
              the importance of local foreign public opinion for foreign policy
              analysis and call for a more balanced scholarly debate on the
              externalities of the global US military presence.},

  abstract = {The war in Ukraine has manifested the critical importance of the
              American alliance network and the swift and effective deployment of
              necessary military assets. But do citizens of the U.S. allies
              support the deployment of such advanced, thus controversial,
              military assets in their countries? To examine this question, we
              administered two conjoint experiments in Japan, a critical U.S.
              ally in Asia. The results show the Japanese citizens’ strong
              Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) sentiment: They value the U.S.-Japan
              alliance per se but do not want those advanced arms (speciﬁcally,
              Osprey and F-35 ﬁghter jets) to be deployed in their vicinity,
              particularly when the U.S. military operates them. Our study
              contributes to the literature on alliance politics and
              civil-military relations by emphasizing the importance of paying
              close attention to local public opposition as a potential source of
              instability in global military alliances.},
